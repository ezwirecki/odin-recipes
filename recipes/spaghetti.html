        <h3>How to Make Spaghetti al Pomodoro</h3>
        <p> Spaghetti al Pomodoro translates to spaghetti with tomato sauce. It’s a classic Italian dish that I love creating when I’m short
            on time but I still want to be transported to Nonna’s house. This 15-minute recipe produces the most flavor-rich sauce and the
            key is using fresh, ripe tomatoes and aromatic basil.</p>
        <p> If you can believe it, tomatoes weren’t mixed into pasta until the 1800s! Before that, pasta was eaten plain or only with cheese. 
            I love eating it both ways but once you try this dish you might even prefer it over slow cooked sauce.

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p>If you want to make your own spaghetti al pomodoro follow next steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>You can’t make tomato sauce without tomatoes! Start your spaghetti al pomodoro by slicing the cherry tomatoes in half after removing the vine</li>
            <li>Pour the EVOO in a large cooking pan before adding crushed garlic. Don’t miss out on extra flavor by forgetting to scrape the garlic press.</li>
            <li>Next, cut your cherry tomatoes in half and add them into the pan with a generous amount of salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Cook the tomatoes on medium-low heat until you see the juices come out, stirring continuously.</li>
            <li>Break the basil (stalk included!) into pieces, add it to the pan, and stir to infuse the flavor.</li>
            <li>The longer you cook the tomatoes, the more juice you'll see. After ten or so minutes, remove the basil pieces from the pan and add the mixture to a blender.</li>
            <li>Pulse the sauce for about three seconds – it's essential to blend gently and quickly.</li>
            <li>Add rock salt into a large pot with 5L of boiling water before twisting and dropping the pasta in. You might need to lightly push the pasta into the water with a spoon.</li>
            <li>For al dente pasta, cook for 13 minutes or according to exact package directions – don’t throw it against the wall or on your ceiling!</li>
            <li>While the pasta is cooking, add the blended sauce back into the pan on low heat.</li>
            <li>Break small pieces of fresh basil leaves into the sauce for an even stronger basil taste, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Make sure to stir, stir, stir! At the point the pasta is almost cooked, collect a mug full of pasta cooking water.</li>
            <li>Next add the pasta using tongs into the saucepan – it's okay if some water goes in as well. Mix it through ensuring the sauce coats the pasta evenly.</li>
            <li>Use your extra pasta water and add a small amount into the pan. Toss the spaghetti al pomodoro  pasta – if you can!</li>    
            <li>The finishing touch is a drizzle of EVOO and fresh basil. If you’re a cheese lover – add in some Pecorino Romano and give a final toss with the pasta.</li>
            <li>E ora si mangia, Vincenzo’sPlate….Enjoy!</li>
